Instructions

Overview
In this assignment, you will use Terraform and Google Cloud Platform to create a Virtual Machine.  Follow the videos for how to do this.

Note: all of the following links are external links and open in a new tab.

1. Sign up for an account with Google Cloud Platform, and log into the console.  If you have a gmail address, you already have an account.   

2. Create a new project for this course.  In the dashboard, click on current project name (for me, that's ProjectForClass), and within that view, you'll see an option to create a new project.

3. Install terraform (on your computer) [link](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install).  

4. Install gcloud CLI (on your computer) [link](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).  

5. Clone or fork the course github repo  [link](https://github.com/eric-keller/npp-cloud)

6. Deploy the provided code.
   - In the tf-mod1-demo directory is an example terraform.  In provider.tf, you'll need to modify 2 places (both marked FILL-IN).

7. ssh into the deployed VM.  use both the gloud method, and with the ssh link from the GCP console.
